K Tutorial --- LAMBDA++ --- Wrapping Up and Documenting LAMBDA++
by Grigore Rosu

In this lesson we wrap up and nicely document LAMBDA++.  In doing so, we also
take the freedom to reorganize the semantics a bit, to make it look better
to the reader.

See the lambda.k file, which is self-explanatory.

Tutorial 3 is now complete.  Tutorial 4 will teach you more features of the
K framework, in particular how to exhaustively explore the behaviors of
non-deterministic or concurrent programs.
