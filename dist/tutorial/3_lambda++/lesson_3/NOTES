* Cut-and-paste is a poor-man's approach to reuse.

Indeed, it is.  A better way to reuse, which requires a bit of planning ahead,
is to put each feature in its own module.  Then you can simply include the
modules containing the features you want to reuse.  Our point in this lesson
was that such reuse is possible, not to teach the best way to do it in
practice.  Good methodologies on how to use a technology are equally important.
