Currently, all class members (fields and/or methods) are public in KOOL.
Sometimes we want to keep members of a class private, in the sense that
subclasses do not have direct access to those members.  This exercise asks
you to add private members to untyped KOOL.  Syntactically, you should
allow a new keyword, "private", to optionally precede member
declarations.  For example, "private var x=10, y=10;" or "private
method f(x,y) {...}".

Semantically, the private members should have the
same semantics as in conventional OO programming languages, say
Java.  For simplicity, you can assume that all members defined in a
class, private or public, are distinct.  Also, you can assume that
methods are identified, for overriding purposes, only by their name
(and not by their result or arguments type).
