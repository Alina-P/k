To test the definition against all the programs in this folder, execute

  ktest ../simple-untyped.k --programs . --extension simple --exclude dekker

The --exclude option tells which programs to exclude from krunning.  You may
want to exclude programs which take a lot of time, or which don't terminate.

If you want to skip the PDF poster generation, which takes some time, execute

  ktest ../simple-untyped.k --programs . --extension simple --exclude dekker --skip pdf

If you already kompiled your definition and want to only krun the programs:

  ktest ../simple-untyped.k --programs . --extension simple --exclude dekker --skip "kompile pdf"
