If your solution is in the parent folder, to test your definition you can call

  ktest config.xml

in this folder.  If you want to skip the kompilation and pdf generation, then
use the following command instead:

  ktest config.xml --skip "kompile pdf"

Both the original SIMPLE untyped programs and the programs in this folder
will be tested.  If your solution is correct, then all tests should pass,
except, potentially, the new break-from-function.simple (see the comments
there for the reason).

If your solution is somewhere else, for example somewhere outside the K tool
folder as it is the case when these exercises are class homework assignments
which need to be autograded, then you need to set the root directories
in the command line of ktest.  For example, suppose that the k distribution
is installed at "/home/cs422-Fall-2013/k" and that you solve this exercise
in "/home/cs422-Fall-2013/johhnytest/hw3/ex1".  Then to run the same tests
as above, you should first create a folder "programs" under your "ex1" in case
you do not already have it, and then execute the command

ktest /home/cs422-Fall-2013/k/dist/tutorial/2_languages/1_simple/1_untyped/exercises/exercise_1/programs/config.xml -d programs --programs /home/cs422-Fall-2013/k/dist/tutorial/2_languages/1_simple/1_untyped/exercises/exercise_1/programs

The "ex1/programs" folder is needed only because the provided config.xml
searches for the .k definition from the lower "programs" folder in the k
distribution, so we have to mimik that situation.  The -d option sets the
root directory for the .k definitions in the config.xml file.  The --programs
option, when used with config.xml, sets the root directory for programs.
