To test your definition, you can call

  ktest config.xml

in this folder.  If you want to skip the kompilation and pdf generation, then
use the following command instead:

  ktest config.xml --skip "kompile pdf"

Both the original SIMPLE untyped programs and the programs in this folder
will be tested.  If your solution is correct, then all tests should pass,
except, potentially, for the new break-from-function.simple (see the comments
there for the reason).
