To test your definition, you can call

  ktest config.xml

in this folder.  If you want to skip the kompilation and pdf generation, then
use the following command instead:

  ktest config.xml --skip "kompile pdf"

Both the original SIMPLE typed programs and several new programs will
be tested.  If your solution is correct, then all tests should pass,
except for ex01, ex02, ex03, ex05, and ex08 from the new programs.
