Same as exercise 2 of the dynamically typed SIMPLE, but for statically
typed SIMPLE.  In other words, extend the syntax of statically typed
SIMPLE to allow "throws" clauses as part of function declarations, and
then define a static semantics for them.  When type checking a function
call, assume that the function can throw any of the exception types
declared as part of its throw clause.  To test your static semantics, use
the programs provided as part of exercise 2 in dynamically typed SIMPLE.
