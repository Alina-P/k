To test your definition, you can call

  ktest config.xml

in this folder.  If you want to skip the kompilation and pdf generation, then
use the following command instead:

  ktest config.xml --skip "kompile pdf"

Both the original SIMPLE typed programs and several new programs will
be tested.  If your solution is correct, then all tests should pass,
except for exceptions_02 and exceptions_09 from the original programs,
and for ex03, ex07, ex08, ex09, and ex13 from the new programs.
