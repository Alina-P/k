To test your definition, you can call

  ktest config.xml

in this folder.  If you want to skip the kompilation and pdf generation, then
use the following command instead:

  ktest config.xml --skip "kompile pdf"

If your solution is correct, then all tests should pass, except for
ex03, ex07, ex08, ex09, and ex13.
