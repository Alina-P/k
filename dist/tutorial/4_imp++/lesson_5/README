K Tutorial --- IMP++ --- Deleting, Saving and Restoring Cell Contents
by Grigore Rosu

- add semantics for "halt;", deleting the contents of the <k/> cell
- krun sum-io.imp and see that it works
- however, the semantics of blocks is wrong: krun locals.imp
- give the environment-save/-restore semantics of blocks
- krun locals.imp and see that it works well now
