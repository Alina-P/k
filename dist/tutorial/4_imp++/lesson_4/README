K Tutorial --- IMP++ --- Semantic Lists; Input/Output Streaming
by Grigore Rosu

- add list <in/> and <out/> cells, to be used for read() and print(a1,...,an)
- add strings as results, plus overload addition on them (as concatenation)
- give semantics of read and print
- krun io.imp and see how it gets stuck on read
- add some items in the <in/> cell, for example
  <in> ListItem(3) ListItem(5) ListItem(7) </in>
- krun io.imp and see/understand the resulting configuration
- stream <in/> and <out/> to stdin and stdout, resp.
- krun io.imp and see the configuration
- krun io.imp --no-config to not see the configuration; got an IMP interpreter
- krun sum-io.imp and see how it gets stuck on halt;
