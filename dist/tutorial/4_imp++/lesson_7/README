K Tutorial --- IMP++ --- Wrapping up Larger Languages
by Grigore Rosu

In this lesson we wrap up IMP++'s semantics and also generate its poster.
While doing so, we also learn how to display larger configurations in order
to make them easier to read and print.

Tutorial 4 is now complete.  At this moment you should know most of K
framework's features and how to use the K tool.  You can now define or design
your own programming languages, and then execute and analyze programs.

Tutorial 5 discusses a few other features of the K framework, which you
may find useful when defining more complex or tricky language features.
