K Tutorial --- LAMBDA --- A Complete and Docummented K Definition
by Grigore Rosu

The K tool allows a literate programming style, where the executable
language definition can be documented by means of annotations.  Some
backends of the K tool, such as those enabled with the --pdf and the --html
options to the kompile tool (see lessons 3 and 4), know how to interpret
such annotations.

See lambda.k for details on the syntax of annotations and how they work.

Compile lambda.k with the options --pdf and --html and analyze the produced
documented definitions in the two formats.

Tutorial 1 is now complete.  The next tutorial will take us through the
definition of a simple imperative language and will expose us to more
feature of the K framework and the K tool.
