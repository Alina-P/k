1. This is a readme file to help users to install the K-prototype.

2. Prerequisites

Java Runtime Edition (tested with JRE6 or higher)
You can follow the instructions here: 
http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp depending on 
the type of your machine.

To make sure that everything works you should be able to call 'java' from
a Terminal.

3. Install
Unzip this directory in your preferred location. For convenient usage, you can
update pour $PATH with <preferred-location>/bin (strongly recommended,
but optional).

4. Test
Go to one of the examples (let's say /examples/imp). Assuming /bin is in your
$PATH, you can compile definitions using the 'kompile imp.k' command.
To execute a  program you can use 'krun programs/sum.imp'.
