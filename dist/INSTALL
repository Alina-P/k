1. This is a readme file to help users to install the K-prototype.

2. Prerequisites

2.1 Java Runtime Edition (tested with JRE6 or higher)
You can follow the instructions here: 
http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp depending on 
the type of your machine.

To make sure that everything works you should be able to call 'java' from
a Terminal.

2.2 Maude
Linux and Mac:
   Download the binary distribution from http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/download/, 
   unzip it, and update your $PATH with '<extraction-dir>'. Rename 
   'maude.linux' or 'maude.linux64' to 'maude' (depending on your machine) and
   you should be good to go.
Windows:
    Go to http://moment.dsic.upv.es/ and download Maude for Windows. Follow
    the instructions from the instalation wizard.

To test if maude has been corectly installed, type 'maude' in a Terminal. You
should not get any errors or warnings.

Note: maude on windows is 4 to 6 times slower than on linux or mac, so you
may experience considerable delays when compiling and running examples.

3. Install
Unzip this directory in your preferred location. For convenient usage, you can
update pour $PATH with <preferred-location>/bin (strongly recommended,
but optional).

4. Test
Go to one of the examples (let's say /examples/imp). Assuming /bin is in your
$PATH, you can compile definitions using the 'kompile imp.k' command.
To execute a  program you can use 'krun programs/sum.imp'.
