K Tutorial --- LAMBDA --- Strictness
by Grigore Rosu

You can use the attribute "strict" to tell K that the corresponding construct
has a strict evaluation strategy, that is, that its arguments need to be
evaluated before the semantics of the construct applies.

However, in order for the above to work we need to tell which expressions
are meant to be results of computations, so that K will not attempt to
evaluate them anymore.  One way to do it is to make "Val" a syntactic
subcategory of the builtin KResult syntactic category.  See lambda.k.

Compile again and then run some programs.  They should all work as expected.

Now that we have a first complete language definition, we can go ahead and
also generate documentation for it:

  kompile lambda --pdf   (this generates PDF documentation)
  kompile lambda --html  (this generates HTML documentation)

To enhance readability, we may want to replace the keyword "lambda" by the
mathematical lambda symbol in generated documentation.  See the next lesson.
