K Tutorial --- LAMBDA --- Latex Attributes
by Grigore Rosu

Here we learn how to associate Latex attributes to language constructs, to
control the way we display them in the generated documentation.

This is actually quite easy.  All we have to do is to associate a "latex"
attribute to the production defining the construct in questions, following
the Latex syntax for defining new commands (or macros).

In our case, we associate the atrribute "latex(\lambda{#1}.{#2})" to the
production declaring the lambda abstraction (in Latex, where #n refers to the
n-th argument of the defined new command).

Now we have a simple programming language, with a nice documentation.  However,
it is not easy to write interesting programs in this language.  Almost all
programming languages built upon existing data-types and libraries.  The K
tool provides a few of these (and the user can add more).  We next show how we
can add builtin integers and booleans to LAMBDA, so we can start to evaluate
meaningful expressions.
