K Tutorial
by Grigore Rosu

Here you will learn how to use the K tool by means of a few simple languages
defined using K.  The objective here is to earn K, not the defined languages
nor their underlying paradigms.  If you are interested in the latter, then you
should check the various language definitions under the "examples" folder.

It is recommended to study the languages defined in this folder in the order
indicated by their name, because K features already discussed in a previous
language definitionswill likely not be rediscussed in latter definitions.
