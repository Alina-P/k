K tool, version 3.0

K is a framework for programming language design and executable semantics.
This distribution contains a tool prototype which implements many of K's
freatures.  For more on the K framework and how to use the current tool,
go to k/tutorial (start with the README file there).

Note: This README file contains information regarding the stable release of
the K tool indicated in the title above, regardless of whether it came with
the release itself or with subsequent nightly/latest builts.  This file is
updated only when new stable versions are officially released.


What is new (from v2.7)

* The front-end is now implemented completely in Java (previously it was
implemented in a combination of Perl and Maude), making use of SDF (as
distributed with the Spoofax system).
