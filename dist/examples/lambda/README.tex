\section{Introductory notes}

Our generic substitution currently expects binding constructs to contain
precisely two arguments, first being an id which is to be bound in the second.
To signal that a construct is a binding one needs to add this attribute  
to the syntax declaration.

The running configuration must contain the $\mall{white}{k}{}$ cell, 
holding the computation, i.e., the $\lambda$-expression to be evaluated.  

We also need to specify that Values are to be treated as finished computations,
or results.  
We do so by including them in the KResult category.
