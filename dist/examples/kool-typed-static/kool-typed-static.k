/*@ \section{Syntax}
The syntax of statically typed KOOL is identical to that of
dynamically typed KOOL, they both taking as input the same programs.
What differs is the \K strictness attributes.  Like in statically
typed KOOL, almost all language constructs are strict now, since we
want each to type its arguments almost all the time.  Like in the
other two KOOL definitions, we prefer to first list the syntax
borrowed unchanged from SIMPLE and then add the KOOL new constructs. */

/*@ \section{Static semantics}
We first discuss the configuration, then give the static semantics
taken over unchanged from SIMPLE, then discuss the static semantics of
SIMPLE syntactic constructs that needs to change, and in the end we
discuss the static semantics and additional checks specifically
related to the KOOL proper syntax. */

/*@ \subsection{Configuration}
The configuration of our type system consists of a \textsf{tasks}
cell and of an \textsf{out} cell with the same meaning like in
statically typed SIMPLE, plus a cell \texttt{classes} holding data
about each class in a separate \textsf{class} cell.  The \textsf{task}
cells now have two additional optional subcells, namely
\textsf{ctenvT} and \textsf{inClass}.  The former holds a temporary
class type environment; its contents will be transferred into the
\textsf{ctenv} cell of the corresponding class as soon as all the
fields and methods in the task are processed.  In fact, there will be
three types of tasks in the subsequent semantics, each determined by
the subset of cells that it holds:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em Main task}, holding only a \textsf{k} cell holding the
original program as a set of classes.  The role of this task is to
process each class, generating a class task (see next) for each.
\item {\em Class task}, holding \textsf{k}, \textsf{ctenvT}, and
\textsf{inClass} subcells.  The role of this task type is to process
a class' contents, generating a class type environment in the
\textsf{ctenvT} cell and a method task (see next) for each method in
the class.  To avoid interference with object member lookup rules
below, it is important to add the class type environment to a class
atomically; this is the reason for which we use \textsf{ctenvT}
temporary cells within class tasks (instead of adding each member
incrementally to the class' type environment).
\item {\em Method task}, holding \textsf{k}, \textsf{tenv} and
\textsf{return} cells.  These tasks are similar to SIMPLE's function
tasks, so we do not discuss them here any further.
\end{enumerate}
Each \textsf{class} cell hods its name (in the \textsf{className}
cell) and the name of the class it extends (in the \textsf{extends}
cell), as well as its type environment (in the \textsf{ctenv} cell)
and the set of all its superclasses (in the \textsf{extendsAll} cell).
The later is useful for checking whether there are cycles in the
class extends relation. */

Since we reduce method declarations to variable declarations (see

can shadow previous homonymous local or member declarations, member
declarations are regarded as a set, so we disallow multiple
declarations for the same member (one could improve upon this, like in
Java, by treating members with different types or number of arguments
as different, etc., but we do not do it here).  We also issue an error
message if one attempts to redeclare the same class member.  The
framed variable declaration in the second rule below should be read
``stuck''.  In fact, it is nothing but a unary operation called
\texttt{stuck}, which takes a \K-term as argument and does nothing
with it; this \texttt{stuck} operation is displayed as a frame in this

first, that the method's type is consistent with the type of the

types correctly.  At the same time, it should also be added to the
type environment of its class.  The first conceptual task is performed
using the \texttt{checkMethod} operation defined below, and the second
by generating a corresponding method task.  To add it to the class
type environment, we take advantage of the fact that KOOL is higher
order and reduce the problem to a field declaration problem, which we
have already defined.  The role of the \textsf{ctenvT} cell in the

To type \texttt{new} we only need to check that the class constructor
can be called with arguments of the given types, so we initiate a call
to the constructor method in the corresponding class.  If that
succeeds, meaning that it types to \texttt{stmt}, then we discard the
\texttt{stmt} type and produce instead the corresponding class type of
the new object.  The auxiliary \texttt{discard} operation is defined
also at the end of this module. */

/*@ \subsection{Object member access}
There are several cases to consider here.  First, we should redirect
variable lookups to member accesses when the variable is not local
(the local variables are handled by the rule borrowed from SIMPLE).
This is what the first rule below does.  Second, we should allow
object member accesses as lvalues, which is done by the second rule
below.  These two rules therefore ensure that each necessary object
member access is explicitly allowed for evaluation.  Recall from the
annotated syntax module above that the member access operation is
strict in the object.  That means that that the object is expected to
evaluate to a class type.  The next two rules below define the actual
member lookup operation, moving the search to the superclass when the
member is not found in the current class.  Note that this works
because we create the class type environments atomically; thus, a
class either has its complete type environment available, in which
case these rules can safely apply, or its cell \textsf{ctenv} is not
yet available, in which case these rules have to wait.  Finally, the
fifth rule below reports an error when the \texttt{object} class is
reached. */

type correctly. */

/*@ \subsection{Cleanup tasks}
Finally, we need to clean up the terminated tasks.  Each of the three
types of tasks is handled differently.  The main task is replaced by a
method task holding ``\texttt{new main();}'', which will ensure that a
\texttt{main} class with a \texttt{main()} method actually exists
(first rule below).  A class task moves its temporary class type
environment into its class' cell, and then it dissolves itself (second
rule).  A method task simply dissolves when terminated (third rule);
the presence of the \textsf{tenv} cell in that rule ensures that that
task is a method task.
Finally, when all the tasks are cleaned up, we can also remove the
\textsf{tasks} cell, issuing a corresponding message.  Note that
checking for cycles or duplicate methods can still be performed after
the \textsf{tasks} cell has been removed. */
