  /*@ \subsection{Values.} 
    The values are a very important syntactic category in the definition
    of any language; with them, we are able to know when the evaluation
    of an expression is finished. This piece of information is crucial, e.g.,
    for the heating and cooling rules. 
    We already defined the subset of values that is part of the syntax, 
    namely the values given by the primitive types. Here we estend the set
    o values with intermediate constructs needed to execute programs. 
    Such a value is\texttt{noVal}, which "paradoxally" denotes in fact 
    "no value". The lambda abstractions are used for storing the
    functions. Similar to other \K examples (IMP, IMPPP, SIMPLE), the 
    functions are stored similar to variables and therefore their definitions
    are seen as values.
    As usual, all values must be subsorted to the \texttt{KResult} sort.
