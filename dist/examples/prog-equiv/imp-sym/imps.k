  A configuration is a multiset of tasks. Each task consists of an
  equivalence formula. The patterns are stored into a \texttt{config}
  cell and the condition in the \texttt{formula} cell.
  The cell \texttt{hypos} is for storing the hypotheses met during
  the proving process. It has a structure similar to that of tasks, but
  where the names of cells are changed in order to forbid the rules firing
  for hypotheses, in this way the hypotheses are kept unchanged. 
  The cell \texttt{observers} stores the list of the observer variables.
  The cell \texttt{nextSymVar} is used for generating fresh symbolic names.
