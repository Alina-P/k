The file "peq.k" includes the K implementation of the circular coinduction proof system for the program equyivalence, defined as a bisimulation. The theory can be found in

Andrei Arusoaie, Dorel Lucanu, Vlad Rusu. A Generic Approach to Symbolic Execution. HAL INRIA RR-8189, 2012.

The compilation of the verifier must be done with the following command:
  kompile peq.k --addTopCell

Then you can check equivalence formulas. You can fins several examples of such formulas in the subfolder proframs. These formulas are executed as regular programs. Here is an example:
  krun programs/for-while.peq

If the cell <goals> in the final configuration includes only "success" item, then formula holds.
If the execution time is too long, then very probably the derivation is infinite, which is a sign that the formula does not hold.
