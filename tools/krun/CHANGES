krun has several new options:

--color/--no-color enables/disables color output.

--parens/--no-parens enables/disables parentheses in the output. With
parentheses enabled, krun uses a very simple heuristic for removing *some*
unneeded parentheses. The heuristic is:

Parens are not added around built-in literals like 42, x, and "foo". Parens
are also omitted for any label that has syntax on the outside.  That is, any
label that starts or ends with an underscore will have parens added: _+_,
if_then_else_, lambda_._. Parens are omitted otherwise: `(_`),
if_then_else_fi, while_do_od.

--parser <string> can be used to specify an external parser. <string> can be
any command (with options) that accepts a filename as its last argument and
prints a kast term to standard out.

krun now has a --log-io option which tells the IO wrapper
--createLogs. This will create a krunner.log file in the current
directory which is useful for debugging IO errors.

I've decided to stop trying to guess the position of parentheses when
pretty-printing syntax. Now, I simply don't add any parentheses to the
output, meaning it will look better in most cases, but there's little
chance that the results are re-parseable by Maude/kast.

The coolest new change is the addition of what some people call
"island parsing". If krun fails to parse the contents of a cell, it
will keep going to the next cell. The pretty-printer displays an
unparseable string as the string surrounded by red parentheses. To see
an example of this, type "krun programs/sorting/insertion1.simple" in
simple/untyped. Overall, this means krun is a lot less likely to fail
at parsing.
