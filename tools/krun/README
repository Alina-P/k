Installation instructions:

These instructions assume you have a sane Haskell build environment (with
GHC), which means you should have a command called "cabal" in your PATH.
You should NOT run any of the following commands as root; everything will
be installed into your home directory.

Get the latest package list from Hackage:

$ cabal update

Install language-k, a library for parsing and pretty-printing K stuff:

$ cd tools/language-k
$ cabal install

Install krun:

$ cd tools/krun
$ cabal install

The krun executable will be installed to $HOME/.cabal/bin. Add the
directory to your PATH so you can run it just by typing "krun":

$ export PATH=$HOME/.cabal/bin:$PATH

Now try krun by going into the imp directory and typing:

$ krun programs/collatzPgm.imp

If you have any trouble installing krun or you see something unexpected
while following these directions, please email me:
