## Installation instructions:

Just type 'make'. You will need mercurial installed, and a sane Haskell
environment.


## Old installation instructions:

NOTE: The instructions below are out of date! Please use the provided Makefile
to build and install krun.

These instructions assume you have a sane Haskell build environment (with
GHC), which means you should have a command called "cabal" in your PATH.
You should NOT run any of the following commands as root; everything will
be installed into your home directory.

Get the latest package list from Hackage:

$ cabal update

Install language-k, a library for parsing and pretty-printing K stuff:

$ cd tools/language-k
$ cabal install

Install krun:

$ cd tools/krun
$ cabal install

The krun executable will be installed to $HOME/.cabal/bin. Add the
directory to your PATH so you can run it just by typing "krun":

$ export PATH=$HOME/.cabal/bin:$PATH

Now try krun by going into the imp directory and typing:

$ krun programs/collatzPgm.imp
