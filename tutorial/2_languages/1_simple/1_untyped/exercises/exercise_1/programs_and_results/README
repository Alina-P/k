To test your solution, go to the folder where it is located (i.e., where
the file simple-untyped.k that you wrote is) and then call the ktest
tool on the config.xml file (the one in this folder).  For example,
if your solution is in the parent folder, to test it go there and type

  ktest programs_and_results/config.xml

As another example, if the k distribution is installed at
"/home/cs422-Fall-2013/k" and if you solve this exercise
in "/home/cs422-Fall-2013/johhnytest/hw3/ex1", then test it by executing
the following command from the folder where your solution is:

ktest /home/cs422-Fall-2013/k/dist/tutorial/2_languages/1_simple/1_untyped/exercises/exercise_1/programs_and_results/config.xml

If you want to skip the kompilation and the pdf generation, then use the
following command instead (and similarly for the second example above):

  ktest programs_and_results/config.xml --skip "kompile pdf"

If you want to skip only one of kompile or pdf (typically the pdf), then use
only that one in the --skip option (e.g., --skip pdf).

Both the original SIMPLE untyped programs and the programs in this folder
will be tested.  If your solution is correct, then all tests should pass,
except, potentially, the new break-from-function.simple (see the comments
there for the reason).

If your solution is somewhere else, then use the -d option of ktest to give
the directory to where your K definition is located.  For example, provided
that your definition is in the parent folder, then to test it you can type
the following command in this folder (i.e., programs_and_results):

  ktest config.xml -d ..
