To test your definition, you can call

  ktest config.xml -d ..

in this folder, or

  ktest results/config.xml

in the parent folder.

Both the original SIMPLE typed programs and several new programs will
be tested.  If your solution is correct, then all tests should pass,
except for exceptions_02 and exceptions_09 from the original programs,
and for ex03, ex07, ex08, ex09, and ex13 from the new programs.
