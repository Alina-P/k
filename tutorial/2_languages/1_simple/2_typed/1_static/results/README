To test this definition, you can call ktest on the config.xml file in this
folder.  Recall that if you call ktest from any other folder than where
your definition is, then you need the option "-d path/to/your/def/directory".
For example, if you want to call it from this folder, then type

  ktest config.xml -d ..

If you want to call it from the parent folder then just type:

  ktest results/config.xml

Also recall that if your definition is already kompiled, then you can skip
kompilation to save time using the --skip kompile option; if you want to skip
both kompilation and pdf generation then use the option --skip "kompile pdf".
