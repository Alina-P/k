1. This is a readme file for the developers.

2. Install
Checkout this directory in your desired location and update your $PATH to
/dist/bin.  Then build the .jar binaries by calling ant on $K_BASE.

3. Work on Java code
Open eclipse and set your workspace to /javasources.  Go to 
File->Import->General->Existing projects into workspace, and select all of 
the projects from /javasources.  
If you have the spoofax plugin installed in eclipse, you might be able to 
work and compile directly within eclipse (the main project is K3Java and 
can be used to test the main functionalities).

If your do not have the spoofax plugin, you can still use eclipse as an editor
and to test functionality not related to parsing.  

If you only modified java files, you can speed up the rebuilding of the
distributed jar:
  ant java jar


4. Work on Maude code
Modify the Maude files found in /dist/bin/maude.

5. Build the final release zip
Call 'ant release' in the base directory.  Or you can just zip the
/dist folder after you have built the /javasources.

6. Compiling definitions and running programs
assuming  /dist/bin is in your path, you can compile definitions using
the 'kompile' command.  To execute a  program
you can use 'krun'.
