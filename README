1. This is a readme file for the developers.

2. Install
checkout this directory in your desired location and update your $PATH to /dist/bin directory so you can test.

3. Work on java code
Open eclipse with the spoofax plug-in installed and set your workspace to /javasources.
Go to File->Import->General->Existing projects into workspace, and select all of the projects from /javasources.
You can run the K3Java project to test the main functionalities directly from eclipse (main project is K3Java), or you can build the .jar binaries by calling ant on /javasources/K3Java/buld.xml

4. Work on maude code
Build the .jar binaries by calling ant on /javasources/K3Java/buld.xml.
Modify the maude files found in /dist/bin/maude

5. Build the final release zip
Call ant on /buildrelease.xml - not yet implemented (anyone?)
Or you can just zip the /dist folder after you have built the /javasources.
