/*@ \subsection{Configuration}
KOOL adds two nested cells to the configuration of SIMPLE.
The cell \textsf{crntObj} holds data pertaining to the current object,
that is, the object environment in which the code currently in cell
\textsf{k} executes: \textsf{crntClass} holds the current class (which
can change as methods of the current object are invoked );
\textsf{envStack} holds the stack of environments as a list,
each layer corresponding to one class in the objects' instance class
hierarchy; \textsf{location}, which is optional, holds the location in
the store where the current object is or has to be located (this is
useful both for closures and for the semantics of object creation).
The cell \textsf{classes} holds all the declared classes, each class
being held in its own \textsf{class} cell which contains a name
(\textsf{className}), a parent (\textsf{extends}), and the actual
member declarations (\textsf{declarations}). */

/*@ \subsection{Semantics from SIMPLE}
The semantics below is taken over from SIMPLE unchanged.
The semantics of function declaration and invocation, including the
use of the special \texttt{lambda} abstraction value, needs to change
in order to account for the fact that methods are now invoked into
their object's environment.  The semantics of function return actually
stays unchanged.  Also, the semantics of program initialization is
different: now we have to create an instance of the \texttt{main}
class which also calls the constructor \texttt{main()}, while in
SIMPLE we only had to invoke the function \texttt{main()}. 
Finally, the semantics of thread spawning needs to change, too: the
parent thread needs to also share its object environment with the
spawned thread (in addition to its local environment, like in SIMPLE).
This is needed in order to be able to spawn method invokations under
dynamic method dispatch; for example, ``\texttt{spawn run();}'' will
need to look up the method \texttt{run()} in the newly created thread,
operation which will most likely fail unless the child thread shares
the same object environment as the parent thread.  Note that the
\texttt{spawn} statement of KOOL is more permissive than the threads
of Java.  In fact, the latter can be implemented in terms of
\texttt{spawn}---see the program \texttt{threads.kool} for a sketch.  */

of the classes mapped to an environment in the environment stack of
the object.  A method closure encapsulates the method's parameters and
code, as well as the ``object context'' in which the method code
should execute.  This object context includes the current class of the
object (the first argument of \texttt{closure}) and the object
environment stack (located in the object stored at the location
specified as the second argument of \texttt{closure}). */

Once all the classes are processed as above, the computation item
\texttt{execute}, which was placed right after the program in the
initial configuration, is reached.  In SIMPLE, the program was
initialized by calling the method \texttt{main()}.  In KOOL, the
program is initialized by creating an object of class \texttt{main}.
This will also implicitly call the method \texttt{main()} (the
\texttt{main} class constructor).  The emptiness of the \textsf{env}
cell below is just a sanity check, to make sure that the user has not

execution of all the class' declarations (and also of its superclasses').
Field declarations are executed using the already existing semantics
of \texttt{var} from SIMPLE, but method declarations need a new
semantics.  This is defined next.  */

/*@ \subsection{Method declaration}
Like in SIMPLE, method names are added to the environment and bound
to their code.  However, unlike in SIMPLE where each method was
executed in the same environment, namely the program global
environment, a method in KOOL needs to be executed into its object's
environment.  Thus, methods evaluate to closures, which encapsulate
their object's context (i.e., the current class and environment stack
of the object) in addition to method's parameters and body.
This approach to bind method names to method closures in the
environment will also allow objects to pass their methods to other
objects, to dynamically change their methods by assigning them other
method closures, and even to allow all these to be done from other
objects.  This gives the KOOL programmer a lot of power; one should
use this power wisely, though, because programs can become easily
hard to understand and reason about if one overuses these features. */

/*@ \subsection{New}
The semantics of \texttt{new} consists of two actions: memory
allocation for the new object and execution of the corresponding
constructor.  Then the created object is returned as the result of the
\texttt{new} operation; the value returned by the constructor, if any,
is discarded.  The current environment and object are stored onto the
stack and recovered after new (according to the semantics of
\texttt{return} borrowed from SIMPLE, when the statement
``\texttt{return this;}'' in the rule below is reached and evaluated),
because the object creation part of \texttt{new} will destroy them.
The rule below also initializes the object creation process by
emptying the local environment and the current object, and allocating
a location in the store where the created object will be eventually
stored (this is what the ``\texttt{storeObj}'' task after the object
creation task in the rule below will do---its rule is defined
shortly).  The location where the object will be stored is also made
available in the \textsf{crntObj} cell, so that method closures can
refer to it (see rule above). */

/*@ \subsection{Object member access}
We can access an object member (field or method) either explicitly,
using the construct \texttt{e.x}, or implicitly, using only the member
name \texttt{x} directly.  The borrowed semantics of SIMPLE will
already lookup a sole name in the local environment.  The first rule
below reduces implicit member access to explicit access when the name
cannot be found in the local environment.  There are two cases to
analyze for explicit object member access, depending upon whether the
object is a proper object or it is just a redirection to the parent
class via the construct \texttt{super}.  In the first case, we
evaluate the object expression and lookup the member starting with
current class (static scoping).  Note the use of the conditional
evaluation context.  In the second case, we just lookup the member
starting with the superclass of the current class.  In both cases,
the \texttt{lookupMember} task eventually yields a \texttt{lookup(L)}
task for some appropriate location \texttt{L}, which will be further
solved with the corresponding rule borrowed from SIMPLE.  Note that the
current object is not altered by \texttt{super}, so future method
invocations see the entire object, as needed for dynamic method dispatch. */

/*@\subsection{Method invocation}
Unlike in SIMPLE, in KOOL application was declared strict only in its
second argument.  That is because we want to ensure dynamic method
dispatch when the first argument is a method access.  As a
consequence, we need to consider all the cases of interest for the
first argument and to explicitly say what to do in each case.  In all
cases except for method access in a proper object (i.e., not
\texttt{super}), we want the same behavior for the first argument as
if it was not in a method invocation position.  When it is a member
access (the third rule below), we look it up starting with the
instance class of the corresponding object.  This ensures dynamic
dispatch for methods; it actually dynamically dispatches field
accesses, too, which is correct in KOOL, because one can assign method
closures to fields and the field appeared in a method invocation
context.  The last context declaration below says that method
applications or array accesses are also allowed as first argument to
applications; that is because methods are allowed to return methods
and arrays are allowed to hold methods in KOOL, since it is
higher-order.  If that is the case, then we want to evaluate the
method call or the array access.  */
