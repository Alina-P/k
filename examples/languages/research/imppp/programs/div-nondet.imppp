// Make sure you first read and execute the sumPgm programs before this one.
// For best output, we recommend kompiling IMP++ with IO, as in sumPgm-3.imppp
//
// This is a simple program which has several behaviors: it can evaluate to
// 0, 1, 2, 3, as well as to undefined (reaches a division-by-zero: 3/0).
// To see these different behaviors, krun it with the --search option:
//
//   krun programs/div-nondet.imppp --search
