/*@ \subsection{Declarations}
Variable and function declarations are allowed to have a more generous
syntax than how we want them to be used in programs, but the type
system will be defined in such a way that all abuses will be caught.
For example, functions will only be allowed to take typed identifiers
as parameters.  The reason we prefer to allow a more generous syntax is
to simplify our overall syntax by defining fewer syntactic categories.
Recall that, after all, the syntax defined in \K is what we call ``the
syntax of the semantics'', that is, some syntax which is convenient
enough to write the desired semantic rules.  This syntax is not meant
to be used to parse complex programming language, such as C or Java.
While \K's syntax is good enough to parse simple and pedagogical
languages like this one, in practice you are expected to use external
parsers for complex languages. */

have arguments and are not desugared are strict, including the

  imports SIMPLE-TYPED-STATIC-SYNTAX

/*@ \section{Static semantics}
Here we give the type system of SIMPLE using \K.  Like concrete
semantics, type systems defined in \K are also executable.  However,
\K type systems turn into type checkers instead of interpreters when
executed.

The typing process is done in two (overlapping) phases.  In the first
phase the global environment is built, which contains type bindings
for all the globally declared variables and functions.  For functions,
the declared types will be ``trusted'' during the first phase and
simply bound to their corresponding function names and placed in the
global type environment.  At the same time, type-checking tasks that
the function bodies indeed respect their claimed types are generated.
All these tasks are (concurrently) verified during the second phase.
This way, all the global variable and function declarations are
available in the global type environment and can be used in order to
type-check each function code.  This is consistent with the semantics
of untyped SIMPLE, where functions can access all the global variables
and can call any other function declared in the same program.  The
two phases may overlap because of the \K concurrent semantics.  For
example, a function task can be started while the first phase is still
running; moreover, it may even complete before the first phase does,
namely when all the global variables and functions that it needs have
already been processed and made available in the global environment by
the first phase task. */

/*@ \subsection{Extended syntax and results}
The idea is to start with a configuration holding the program to type
in one of its cells, then apply rewrite rules on it mixing types and
language syntax, and eventually obtain a type instead of the original
program.  In other words, the program ``evaluates'' to its type using
the \K rules giving the type system of the language.  In doing so,
additional typing tasks for function bodies are generated and solved
the same way.  If this rewriting process gets stuck, then we say that
the program is not well-typed.  Otherwise the program is well-typed
(by definition).

We start by allowing types to be used inside expressions and
statements in our language.  This way, types can be used together with
language syntax in subsequent \K rules without any parsing errors.
Also, since programs and fragments of program will ``evaluate'' to
their types, in order for the strictness and context declarations to
be executable we state that types are results. */

/*@ \subsection{Configuration}
The configuration of our type system consists of a \textsf{tasks} cell
holding various typing \textsf{task} cells, a global type environment,
and an \textsf{out} cell connected to the standard output to deliver
messages to the user.  Each task includes a \textsf{k} cell holding
the code to type, a \textsf{tenv} cell holding the local type
environment, and a \textsf{return} cell holding the return type of the
currently checked function.  The latter is needed in order to check
whether return statements return values of the expected type. 
Initially, the program is placed in a \textsf{k} cell inside a
\textsf{task} cell.  Since the cells with multiplicity ``?'' are not
included in the initial configuration, the \textsf{task} cell holding
the original program in its \textsf{k} cell will contain no other
subcells. */

/*@ \subsection{Variable declarations}
Variable declarations type as statements, that is, they ``evaluate''
to the type \texttt{stmt}.  We did not need the \texttt{stmt} type as
part of the typed SIMPLE syntax (indeed, programmers are not allowed
to use the \texttt{stmt} type explicitly), so we define it now.  There
are three cases that need to be considered: when the list of variables
is empty (which happens when functions have no arguments, since we
reduce the typing of functions to typing variable declarations and
statements---see below), when a simple variable is declared, and when
an array variable is declared.  The macros at the end of the syntax
module above take care of reducing other variable declarations,
including ones where the declared variables are initialized, to only
these three cases.  The first case is trivial.  The second case has
two subcases: when the variable declaration is global (i.e., the
\textsf{task} cell contains only the \textsf{k} cell), in which case
it is added to the global type environment checking at the same time
that the variable has not been already declared (and outputting an
error message otherwise); and when the variable declaration is local
(i.e., a \textsf{tenv} cell is evaliable), in which case it is simply
added to the local type environment, possibly shadowing previous
homonymous variables.  The third case reduces to the second, but after
checking that the depth of the declared dimension type is smaller than
or equal to the depth of the declared type (it can be strictly
smaller, e.g., when we want the declared array to hold array
references). */

declaring all the function parameters followed by the function body,
