/*@ \section*{Semantics}
This module defines the semantics of IMP.  We first define
its configuration, then its results, and then its semantic rules. */

/*@ \subsection*{Configuration}
The configuration of IMP is trivial: it only contains two cells, one
for the computation and another for the state.  For good encapsulation
and clarity, we place the two cells inside another cell, the ``top'' cell
which is labeled $\top$. */

IMP only has two types of results: integers and Booleans. */

  syntax KResult ::= #Int | #Bool

/*@ \subsection{Arithmetic Expressions}
The \K semantics of each arithmetic construct is defined below.
We need to do nothing for integers. */

/*@ \subsubsection{Variable Lookup}
A program variable $X$ is looked up in state $\Large\sigma$ using the
builtin map lookup operation ${\Large\sigma}(X)$.  Note that this
operation requires $\Large\sigma$ to be defined in $X$; otherwise the
rewriting process will get stuck.  This means that our semantics of
IMP disallows uses of uninitialized variables.  Variables are initialized
using the assignment statement whose semantics is defined below. */

There is nothing special about these, except that the rule for division
has a side condition. */

/*@ \subsection{Boolean Expressions}
The rules below are straightforward.  Note the short-circuited semantics
of \textsf{and}; this is the reason we annotated the syntax of
\textsf{and} with the \K attribute "strict(1)" instead of "strict". */

which needs two rules. */

The \texttt{skip} is simply dissolved.  One can make this
rule structural if one does not want it to count as a computational step. */

  rule skip; => .

/*@ \subsubsection{Assignment}
The assigned variable is updated in the state: ${\Large\sigma}[I/X]$
adds the mapping $X \mapsto I$ to $\Large\sigma$ in case $\Large\sigma$
is not defined in $X$, and it changes the current mapping of $X$
(to point to $I$) in case $\Large\sigma$ is defined in $X$.
At the same time, the assignment is dissolved. */

  rule <k> X=I:#Int; => . <_/k> <state> Sigma => Sigma[I/X] </state> 

/*@ \subsubsection{Sequential Composition}
Sequential composition is simply dissolved into the \K's builtin
task sequentialization operation.  Like for \texttt{skip}, one is
free to make this rule structural if one does not want it to count
as a computational step.  */

The conditional statement has two semantic cases, corresponding to
when its condition evaluates to \texttt{true} or to \texttt{false}. */

  rule if false then _ else S => S

/*@ \subsubsection{While Loop}
We give the semantics of the \texttt{while} loop by unrolling.
Note that the unrolling takes place only when the loop statement
reaches the top of the computation cell; otherwise the unrolling
process may not terminate.  Recall that \K is a rewriting
framework, so one needs to structurally inhibit the
application of rewrite rules; this is in contrast to structural
operational semantics (SOS), where one needs to explicitly give
permission (through conditional rules) to reductions inside
constructs' arguments.  Also note that we preferred to make the
rule below structural.  If one wants this unrolling step to count
as a computational step (though we beg one to reconsider)
then one can remove the ``structural'' tag.  */
