/*@ \section{Syntax}
Since the EXP type inferencer infers all the types automatically,
without requiring the user to declare any type explicitly, the EXP
syntax needed for the type inferencer is identical to the syntax used
for the dynamic, untyped semantics.  What we need is to change the
strictness of the conditional into strict in all its arguments
(indeed, all three of its arguments need to type), and to make sure
the \texttt{let} binder is not desugared anymore into $\lambda$
(because we want the type inferencer to be let-polymorphic).  Instead,
the \texttt{let} binder is declared to be strict in its second
argument (since the bound expression still needs to be typed). */

/*@ \subsection{Let}
The trickiest part of Milner's W procedure is how to type the
\texttt{let} construct.  To allow for let-polymorphism, we bind the
variable to a {\em type schema} instead of a type.  A type schema can
be regarded as a type parametric, or universally quantified, in some
of its type variables.  Type schemas serve as skeletons for types.
Each time the let-bound variable is looked up in the environment, its
type schema is instantiated to a type by replacing its parameters with
fresh type variables.  This way, the let-bound variables can be used
multiple times in multiple contexts in the let-body, without
constraining its type more then needed.  The use of type schemas is
effectively equivalent to the following simpler but slower procedure:
first substitute the let-bound variable with its let-bound
expression within the let-body, and then type the resulting body.
The type schema therefore acts like a summary of the let-bound
expression typing effort, so that we do not redo that work at each
place where the let-bound variable is used.

There are two additional important observations regarding the first
rule below: first, we enforce that all type constraints are solved (by
requiring the \textsf{eqns} cell to be empty; then we apply the
resulting most-general unifier to the let-bound type; then we bind the
let variable to the type schema obtained by parametrizing the solved
let-bound type with all its context-free type variables, that is, by
all those type variables which do not appear in types bound to other
program variables in the type environment.  The type schema construct,
as well as the \texttt{ftv} (free type variables), difference and map
application operations, are defined in the imported \texttt{TYPES}
module. */
