\section{Abstract}
This is the \K definition of the classic W type inference procedure
for the EXP language.  The EXP language and W were originally proposed
by Robin Milner in his seminal paper on type inference below:

\end{quote}
See the \K definition of untyped EXP for the semantics of the various
EXP language constructs.
