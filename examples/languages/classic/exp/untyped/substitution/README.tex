\section{Abstract}
This is the \K semantic definition of the classic EXP language.
The EXP language was originally proposed by Robin Milner in his
seminal paper on type inference below:
\begin{quote}
Robin Milner. A theory of type polymorphism in programming.
{\em Journal of Computer and System Sciences}, 17(3):348-375, 1978.
\end{quote}
EXP is a call-by-value language which captures the essence of
functional languages, providing basic arithmetic expression
constructs, $\lambda$ and $\mu$ abstractions, function application, a
conditional, and (derived) \texttt{let} and \texttt{letrec} binders.
This definition is substitution-based. An alternative,
environment-based \K definition is also available.
