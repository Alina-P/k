\section{Introductory notes}

Our generic substitution expects a special binding construct to bind 
an id into an expression.  
To this generic binding one can associate different binders, such as 
`lambda' or `mu'.

We currently need to specialize the generic binding to our syntax. 
This will be automatically generated as more tool support is added 
for the susbtitution operation.

The running configuration must contain the $\mall{white}{k}{}$ cell, 
holding the computation.  
Moreover, it currently needs the  $\mall{white}{nextId}{}$ cell as well,
to generate fresh ids during the substitution process.

We also need to specify that Values are to be treated as finished computations,
or results.  
We do so by including them in the KResult category.
