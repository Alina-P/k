1. Module inclusion syntax:

require "filename.k"

module SIMPLE-UNTYPED-SYNTAX
  including K
  
endmodule // in one word

2. Priorities instead of precedence:

               | "++" Exp
               > Exp "[" Exps "]"

3. associativity attributes syntax:

               | Exp "%" Exp
               > left:
               	 Exp "+" Exp
               | Exp "-" Exp
               > non-assoc:
               	 Exp "<" Exp


4. brackets (no semantic meaning, used just for grouping and to override priorities):

               | "(" Exp ")"            [bracket]

5. The scope of a variable in k3 is restricted to rule. In k2 it was the module.
As a result, the type of each variable should be specified in each rule in which it is used.

6. +Nat and the entire Nat sort should be transformed into Int
