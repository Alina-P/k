1. Module inclusion syntax:

module SIMPLE-UNTYPED-SYNTAX
  including K

2. Comparators instead of precedence:

               | "++" Exp
               > Exp "[" Exps "]"

3. associativity attributes syntax:

               | Exp "%" Exp
               > left:
               	 Exp "+" Exp
               | Exp "-" Exp
               > non-assoc:
               	 Exp "<" Exp


4. brackets:

               | "(" Exp ")"            [bracket]

5. Ability to use cons attributes:

               	 Exp "<" Exp         	[strict, non-assoc, cons("Exp1LTSyn")]

6. Empty lists should be specified explicitly:

  rule var (E1:Exp, E2:Exp, Es:Exps); => var (E1, .Exps); var (E2, Es);

7. The scope of a variable in k3 is restricted to rule. In k2 it was the module.
As a result, the type of each variable should be specified in each rule in which it is used.

8. +Nat and the entire Nat sort is transformed into Int
