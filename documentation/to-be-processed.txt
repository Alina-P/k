KTEST:
------

To test the definition against all the programs in this folder, go to the
parent folder where the simple-untyped.k definition is and execute

  ktest simple-untyped.k --programs programs_and_results --extension simple --exclude dekker

The --exclude option tells which programs to exclude from krunning.  You may
want to exclude programs which take a lot of time, or which don't terminate.

If you want to skip the PDF poster generation, which takes some time, execute

  ktest simple-untyped.k --programs programs_and_results --extension simple --exclude dekker --skip pdf

If you already kompiled your definition and want to only krun the programs:

  ktest simple-untyped.k --programs programs_and_results --extension simple --exclude dekker --skip "kompile pdf"
